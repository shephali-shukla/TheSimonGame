# The Simon Game

This is a basic implementation of the Simon game, a memory game in which the player must repeat a sequence of button presses in the correct order. This implementation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and features 4 colored buttons, an h1 tag that displays the current level, and a reset mechanism that triggers when the player presses the wrong button.

This project is part of an assignment in the course on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu, "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp". The goal of this project is to help students practice their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a functional and interactive Simon game.

# How to Play
To play the game, simply press any key to start the game. The game will then display a sequence of button presses, which the player must repeat in the correct order by clicking the buttons. The sequence will get longer with each level, making the game progressively more difficult.

If the player makes a mistake by clicking the wrong button, the game will reset and the player will have to start over from level 1.

# Getting Started
To run the game locally on your computer, simply clone or download this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game should start automatically when the page loads.
